Odd things that Lupus590 developed/found to help with mod development

## PBO Decompiler
Filename: pboDecompiler.ps1
### Notes
Lupus590 wrote this for her machine, it probably will need some editing to work on yours.
If it can't decompile a mod, or you want something easier to use then I have had success with Eliteness and the AIO toolset from Mikero [https://mikero.bytex.digital/Downloads](https://mikero.bytex.digital/Downloads)
### requirements
* Arma 3 Tools
* PBO unpacker
* Basic knowledge on how to run a PowerShell script
### useage
* Make a folder somewhere (your desktop is suitable)
* Copy the mod folders that you wish to decompile from your Arma mods folder (you can use the launcher to find them)
* Paste them to the new folder that you made
* Copy the script to the same folder
  * The one you made that has the mod folders in, if you are in a mod folder then the script may not work correctly
* You may wish to edit some of the values at the top of the script file
  * You can open it in any text editor
* Run the script
  * Depending on the number of mods and their size this may take a while
* The script will exit when it is finished
